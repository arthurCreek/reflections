When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository to store and/or share projects on GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may have projects that you are working on where you are not ready to include all the changes into your remote repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is like a clone, but it will be within the GitHub site.  A clone is when you make a copy of a repository onto your computer or to another. A branch is when you would like to keep your master code but want to work on a new feature or something else while keeping our original code intact.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
